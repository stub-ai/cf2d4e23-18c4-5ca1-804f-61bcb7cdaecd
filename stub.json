The entries in this file should be in the increasing order of sequence numbers. Also, the first line of python.csv should be the header, which is same as the one in filename.\n\n(1) filename is a string variable that holds the filename. For example, in the first test case, it is public_1.csv.\n\n(2) You do not have to accept input from the console. You just have to write the function definition.\n\n(3) We shall be printing a random selection of five entries from python.csv.","md5":"5eb9cc72cfdb7bd9da0f14e2869ac4c3"}]}
